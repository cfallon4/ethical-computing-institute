## “Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.”
### ― Immanuel Kant, *Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals*

# ACM Code:
There is a section on avoiding harm which states “When harm is an intentional part of the system, those responsible are obligated to ensure that the harm is ethically justified.” I think this goes well with Deontology as the main goal of Deontology is to have moral actions are considered more than the consequence. The ACM code emphasizes the need to minimize harm unless there is a compelling ethical reason to do otherwise. This could relate to saving the life of a family member in exchange for driving terrorists somewhere- which was an example we read about in our framework. The ACM has strict rules but realizes there might be times when it is necessary to bend the rules. Section 2.3 further explains this as it states that professionals must abide by laws and regulations unless faced with a compelling ethical reason not to.
 
In the ACM code, there is a section about fostering public awareness and understanding about technologies or communicating with the public good. Kant would argue that in Deontology, giving back to the community is unnecessary. He stated that giving a large amount of your paycheck to relieve a lot of the poor was not important and if you want to go see a concert or eat an expensive meal, that was okay and up to you. The code also stresses that professionals should be fair and take action not to discriminate. Deontology differs in that it is okay to put your loved one’s life above a stranger’s life. 

I would say that our framework of Deontology adds specific examples as to when it is and when it is not acceptable to bend the rules of morality and that could add something to this code. Examples of typical situations professionals might be presented with and guidelines for what to do would be beneficial.
